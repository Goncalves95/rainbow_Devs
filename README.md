# **Intro**

Welcome to "Pride Link"! This app that celebrates diversity and inclusivity in the LGBTQ+ community. The website features a Progress Pride Flag, which is a modified version of the traditional Pride Flag that includes additional colors to represent marginalized groups within the community.
This application aims to create a comprehensive resource hub for the LGBTQIA+ community. Our goal is to offer a centralized platform where members of the LGBTQIA+ community and allies can easily access valuable information about support groups, events, and educational resources. By consolidating these resources, we hope to foster a more connected, informed, and empowered LGBTQIA+ community.

Whether you're seeking support, looking to expand your knowledge, or wanting to engage with the community, this hub is designed to be your go-to source for LGBTQIA+ resources and information.

#### Site-goals 
1. **Create a comprehensive resource directory**: We aim to compile a thorough list of LGBTQIA+ organizations, support groups, and resources that cater to the diverse needs of the community.
2. **Foster a sense of community**: We hope to create a platform where members of the LGBTQIA+ community can connect, share their experiences, and support one another.
3. **Promote education and awareness**: We strive to provide access to educational resources, workshops, and events that promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity of the LGBTQIA+ community.
4. **The objective of** the website is to provide information and useful links for the LGBTQIA+ community.

#### Agile Methodology
The project was developed by using agile methodologies. The development cycle was divided into short sprints, where code was delivered in small chunks for flexibility and good coding practice.
Furthermore, the branch system and forking was used to simulate a real-world developer team environment.

The Kanban board was created to keep track of project progression and issues assessment. Issues were given acceptance criteria and were split into tasks if feasible.

## Scope and Plan
